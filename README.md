### Danzun

This an attempt to create a "shoot em' up bullet hell" game engine, heavily inspired by [The Touhou Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project).

The engine is still in a very early phase, so I'm not ready to commit hours writing Doxygen docs when things are liable to change.

I'm developing a bullet hell game to aid in the development of this engine [here](https://github.com/KeinR/textbook_case).
