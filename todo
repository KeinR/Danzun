- UI design
- 3D API
- Instanced rendering
- Geometry shaders
- Set more properties via properties (linke window title) rather than through functions
- score serializer, choose between binary and something ubiquitous like ini
- replay save format that records the positions of the player 
- Text boxes (perhaps? Or is that too much? I suppose it would depend a lot on the implementation...)
- Async loading
    - Thread safety
